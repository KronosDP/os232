# LINKS
* [Linux tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=59V2boc0XfmlFekg&v=oGyJr-iUwt8&feature=youtu.be) -- actually it's very helpful to learn it because I can write this message from my terminal, not my notepad :D. Also, navigating directory is actually pretty interesting now.
* [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) -- an important aspect of programmer's life is to make readme files. In readme files, we often use markdown. That's why I included this link.
* [Moving to the end of line in vi](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/105721/how-do-i-move-to-end-of-line-in-vim) -- It's very important to know shortcut. We can use `$' (dollar sign) key to move to the end of the line.
