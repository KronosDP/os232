# LINKS
* [Linux tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=59V2boc0XfmlFekg&v=oGyJr-iUwt8&feature=youtu.be) -- actually it's very helpful to learn it because I can write this message from my terminal, not my notepad :D. Also, navigating directory is actually pretty interesting now.
* [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) -- an important aspect of programmer's life is to make readme files. In readme files, we often use markdown. That's why I included this link.
* [Moving to the end of line in vi](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/105721/how-do-i-move-to-end-of-line-in-vim) -- It's very important to know shortcut. We can use `$' (dollar sign) key to move to the end of the line.
* [Scp command](https://www.howtogeek.com/804179/scp-command-linux/) -- Before, I don't know what is scp. But after learning it, it's not that hard. SCP is basically the same as cp (copy) but for copying in different environtment (yes I know this isn't the formal term).
* [PowerShell looks better!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-G6GbXGo4wo) -- Honestly, I think studying cs is one thing. But being cool also counts as an important thing. That's exactly why I want to make my Powershell looks better. I made my powershell such that it looks like an ubuntu CLI kinda thingy.
* [fork() in c](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fork-system-call/) -- How I interpret fork() in c is basically like an amoeba. It splits itself in half and called it it's decendants (child). 
* [PID and PPID](https://linuxguru85.blogspot.com/2014/07/what-are-pid-and-ppid-child-and-parent.html) -- Found this webthat showed me what PID and PPID really means.
